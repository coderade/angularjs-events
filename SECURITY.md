# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The examples in this project are not updated anymore.

Also, besides the libraries are receiving security updates with the help of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) and 
[dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) tools. I am not checking the libraries compatibility with the project.
